### Introduction

Test cases are written using Cypress Framework with Typescript and CICD actions over Circle CI with Docker and Github actions.

---

# Getting Started

To install the dependencies you're gonna need to authenticate your npm client.
After cloning the repo, In the command line, install the package dependencies using the command `npm install` or `npm i`

# Testing Framework
Cypress

# Local Setup
UnZip this file locally and open it in IDE

# Running E2E tests locally

Run the tests using the command `npm run test`. This brings the Cypress runner. You can now run the tests.

# Github action

yml file has been added and github actions are running successfully

# Circle CI with Docker (iOS and Android included)

yml file has been added but Circle CI actions are *not* running successfully because I have ran out of free credits to test it properly.
